### Prerequisites

1. Set up [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html), which is the most popular Java dependency management tool.

### Instructions

1. Download the **DOWNLOAD_LINK** as a ZIP file.
1. Extract the app source code.
1. Open a command line window and navigate to the folder where you extracted the app.
1. Run `mvn clean install` to compile the source code into a binary.
1. Run the binary using `java -jar target\kusto-quickstart-[version]-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.

### Troubleshooting

* If you are having trouble running the app from your IDE, first check if the app runs from the command line, then consult the troubleshooting references of your IDE.
